# OpenPnP-Prerunner
Graphical preprocessor to get your poorly setup PnP-Files ready for OpenPnP

As Pick and Place machines around OpenPnP get more popular, many users may face the same Issue as myself: 
Your layouting programm isnt setup correctly for generating accurate PnP-Files: Troughhole-Footprints are exported, Footprints are not correctly rotated and/or have not the correct centerpoints.

This tool aims to solve this problems with a set of features to make the batch-process needep for preprocessing easy.
